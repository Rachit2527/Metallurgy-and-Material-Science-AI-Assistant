# MetAIxpert - Metallurgical and Materials Science Generative AI Platform

Welcome to the Materials Science and Metallurgy AI Assistant. This app leverages advanced Generative AI models to assist in predicting and optimizing material properties, especially for metallurgical applications. Developed using Streamlit, LangChain, and HuggingFace, this tool provides AI-driven insights for researchers and engineers in materials science.

## Features

1.Alloy Composition Generation
Generate optimal alloy compositions based on specific material requirements (e.g., hardness, tensile strength, thermal properties).

2.Material Property Prediction
Predict mechanical and thermal properties (e.g., tensile strength, hardness, thermal conductivity) of materials based on their chemical composition.

3.Corrosion Resistance Prediction
Analyze and predict a material's resistance to corrosion in various environments and recommend alloying elements for improved resistance.

4.Heat Treatment Outcome Prediction
Estimate the effects of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of metals, predicting changes in hardness, ductility, and phase composition.
